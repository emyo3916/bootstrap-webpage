    <h1>OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.</h1>
    <p>Fry, we have a crate to deliver. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. I had more, but you go ahead. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</p>
    <p>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Ask her how her day was. Throw her in the brig. <strong> Look, last night was a mistake.</strong> <em> Man, I'm sore all over.</em> I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.</p>
    <h2>It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</h2>
    <p>When will that be? You lived before you met me?! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.</p>
